            The genius inventor with crazy contorted ideas. Can you turn any object into a tool? Make bookshelves out of
            cardboard, timers out of marble and string. See if you have the mechanical mastery of using everyday objects
            to do something extraordinary.

            Preliminaries :
        </h5>
        <p>
            A contest becomes a challenge if and only if you have incentive. Or in this case, a strong dislike for raw
            eggs. Because in the prelims of this event, you have just one challenge - Bring out your creativity and
            intuition to use an egg in a contraption that performs a decided task.
            So, Use the Egg, and Do not break it
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Teams of upto 4 members.
            </li>
            <li>
                You will be provided with only ONE egg and will get two chances to perform the given task.
            </li>
            <li>
                Points will be based on duration and complexity of the system and the displacement of egg from the cup.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top 20 teams qualify for the finals.
            </li>

        <h5>
            Finals :
        </h5>
        <p>
            Its time to roll up those sleeves and put on your extra large thinking caps! The key to winning this
            contest- make best use of your assets- your time, your brain, yourselves, and of course, the mystery item!
            Here you have 180 mins to come up with a working Goldberg machine which performs any one among the
            pre-determined tasks and must include the given mystery item.
            This is your chance to Think, Plan, Build, and most importantly, feel accomplished when your complex
            contraption effectively performs simplicity.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Only mystery items will be provided.</li>
            <li>The system must contain the mystery item and should accomplish the task the mystery item provides. </li>
            <li>Teams must bring their own items.</li>
            <li>No electrical/electronic/pre-built components will be allowed/provided.</li>
