                    <b>Cyber security:</b><br>
                    The best way to outsmart someone, is to become them. Learn how they think, what makes them tick. So
                    that’s
                    how we approach cyber security, not by hiding and avoiding, but by penetrating and attacking our own
                    system
                    to see where it fails. Fix it, so that the real hackers can’t get in.
